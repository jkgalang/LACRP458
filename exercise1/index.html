<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!<br> <b>My name is Jacqueline Galang <b/> and I am a senior majoring  in Environmental Science with minors in GIS and Sustainability.  I am on campus this semester. I don't have any experience with HTML or JavaScript, but I do have some experience with R and MatLab. I have taken quite a few GIS classes and have used it to create my own maps as a tool when presenting research. From this course I am hoping to widen my GIS skill set and gain more experience coding..</p>
